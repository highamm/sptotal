Description: Performs predictions of totals and weighted sums, or finite population block kriging, on spatial data using the methods in Ver Hoef (2008) <doi:10.1007/s10651-007-0035-y>. The primary outputs are an estimate of the total, mean, or weighted sum in the region, an estimated prediction variance, and a plot of the predicted and observed values. This is useful primarily to users with ecological data that are counts or densities measured on some sites in a finite area of interest. Spatial prediction for the total count or average density in the entire region can then be done using the functions in this package.
